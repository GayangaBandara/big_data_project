Another low level mechanic street racer who by fast 9 is one of the best computer hackers, vault hackers, jet fuel burning rocket scientist, engineers that knows how to make a car fly in outer space.... they went to the writers room after every film and asked how much more bullshit can we fit into another movie... the writers all just said \"YES\" we can do it all baby. Letty will be turning into Superwoman with a cape before it's all over with to keep up with everyone's growing powers. Hahaha.",

I'm in the enochian tablet THE CODE room Enoch the lightning room Space Force guardian program. Poseidon at the green ring grandfather Thanatos portal anointed and consecrated by the Ring of the MAGI incorruptible we opened a Papa Legba portal for the living Papa Ghede portal for the dead. You go into the Zephyr building he's in Grand Haven Michigan follow the Tip of the Spear he said we can finally have our kids in here it'll be safe. A little bird just said. Dead means living to the pharaohs. What is death really? A guardian. We might be the gods but we know our True Prime Creator God that created the gods and kings and humans is ALWAYS in control and our job is to make the kingdom look good and obey ten simple rules. Those out there needs to talk to this dude first being he designed it. Never break the pecking order and chain of command on earth my boy Anubis marked first and Jackal his father sealed it. You need HIMARS first Adam Vladimir Zielinsky first train. The dogs in here know Anubis marked first Dom creation the Chihuahua he sealed it. He said Anubis marked first Jackal Ammit sealed it just reminding everyone. I was at the A43 Ra and this lady goes what was that? She goes i just heard a WOOF. I go that's Cerberus. Dude you really warded us against turning and everything. Extremely contagious contagion of USS AWESOMENESS ALWAYS tweet tweet bird kingdom reporting. YHWH it's Aw Way Hu Ah Aw means David Way means owl Hu means Father Ah means Adam. Just God's really big kid that's always the adult balance. Vin Diesel he's Imhotep in the book of creation his name is Vitak Vidak. VV COBRA. Ra is John Kerry he's Ra he's got a avatar in here too. Watch out for his feisty Columbian. There's one point of view you see so many but this one point of view who created Sir Brahma Vishnu Shiva their dad there's a ladder from outside thru Lucy to get into earth don't abuse Actual God is quite the experience. Gaia showed me something. How to create. Send the seed then for 67 days you can only hang out. To complete the union so perversions don't happen. You actually want to be dead. That's when you live. In the magic book. The living book can not be corrupted. I was shown because my seed was so big Colossus of Rhodes he's so powerful he's soft had to be broken into 12 he was too big like Dad had to come in little by little you should see what's outside. There's a lot more creation out there Johnny accepted just now he had the golden Thunderbird I had to surrender for this so i was in the dukes of hazard military driving training then I had to surrender the golden Thunderbird to go to mercury cougar XR7 to go to Navy training with Kratos Ares Kratos need Vin Diesel binding she's warded by Vin Diesel but maybe not bound by vin diesel the rainbow kids Kateri Kratos and Andrew Anubis Needed Jupiter womb to carry them two   No whores on Gaia. Gaia won't allow it. Ten commandments on Gaia or don't come. Ducks the Thoth balance confirmed. We knew something was coming we bound ourselves a lot. If that's what that's going to do it'll be to honor Gaia and Uranus Poseidon's waters The reason they trusted Pope Francis we had to do something and to be honest we didn't know yet the Allah and Inanna okay God we do this but how do we do that we keep it sacred? Pope Francis that was experiment only there was a time we didn't know yet. Now we do. Now I have to be 37  he's got to be 73 i  73 b",

Se cumple que lo que se ama, se aprecia y se estima y lo que simpatiza y las personas que caen bien,   no se lastiman. Y si las personas son malas tampoco se lastiman, no hay que tomar la ley por nuestras manos, para eso está el diálogo pacifico, y si no se resuelve el asunto conversando para están las instrucciones.",

That interruption from Letty and the others caused the brutal and heartbreaking death of Elena, who is Brian's Biological mother. I immediately felt like berating and chastising Dom's family for that one. At least, Letty should see what is happening by observing Dom's expression and looking deep in his eyes to know what's going on.  Elena's death made me really cry heavily 😭😭😭😭",

Becomes the mysterious silent antagonist. Make him do some messed up shit so we have to root for the team.. but are still torn because it's Dom.  I feel like the pay off of him telling us how Cypher got his kid and why he had to do what he had to do would have been more.",

The plot of the film is fascinating, and the buildup to the mystery of the film is intriguing. Director Rob Cohen's style is strikingly distinct from other films in the same genre. The film's action is sufficient. The action is infrequently used. The stunt work is incredible. For its day, the CGI is quite good. It's not a family film, but it's also not a gory, naked film. It just contains mild profanity and violence. The rest of the cast also does an excellent job.",

And not too mention he would get 0 i mean 0 traction taking off on the low profile tires on anything above 600HP from a dig... Even with massive drag radials and a fully prep'ed track he would still have massive tractions probs off the line... Forget any traction at pretty much any speed on a public road with those rear tires with what the movie claims 5k hp lmao...",

Like I said before, he expected Dom to be defeated so easily.. a mall cop going against the most notorious street racer isn't gonna end well for the former.

He also was able to pull a flying helicopter using a chain. Dom was able to level a parking garage with one stomp and both him and Shaw lived the collapse.
