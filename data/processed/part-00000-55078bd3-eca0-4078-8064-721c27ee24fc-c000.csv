Another low level mechanic street racer who by fast 9 is one of the best computer hackers, vault hackers, jet fuel burning rocket scientist, engineers that knows how to make a car fly in outer space.... they went to the writers room after every film and asked how much more bullshit can we fit into another movie... the writers all just said \"YES\" we can do it all baby.

@ammitthedevourerofsouls,Hey Dom Vin Diesel Riddick Imhotep aka Vitak Vidak the supreme master race architect it's me Oracle of God just confirming. I'm in the enochian tablet THE CODE room Enoch the lightning room Space Force guardian program. Poseidon at the green ring grandfather Thanatos portal anointed and consecrated by the Ring of the MAGI incorruptible we opened a Papa Legba portal for the living Papa Ghede portal for the dead. You go into the Zephyr building he's in Grand Haven Michigan follow the Tip of the Spear he said we can finally have our kids in here it'll be safe. A little bird just said. Dead means living to the pharaohs. What is death really? A guardian. We might be the gods but we know our True Prime Creator God that created the gods and kings and humans is ALWAYS in control and our job is to make the kingdom look good and obey ten simple rules. Those out there needs to talk to this dude first being he designed it. Never break the pecking order and chain of command on earth my boy Anubis marked first and Jackal his father sealed it. You need HIMARS first Adam Vladimir Zielinsky first train. The dogs in here know Anubis marked first Dom creation the Chihuahua he sealed it. He said Anubis marked first Jackal Ammit sealed it just reminding everyone. I was at the A43 Ra and this lady goes what was that? She goes i just heard a WOOF. I go that's Cerberus. Dude you really warded us against turning and everything. Extremely contagious contagion of USS AWESOMENESS ALWAYS tweet tweet bird kingdom reporting. YHWH it's Aw Way Hu Ah Aw means David Way means owl Hu means Father Ah means Adam. Just God's really big kid that's always the adult balance. Vin Diesel he's Imhotep in the book of creation his name is Vitak Vidak. VV COBRA. Ra is John Kerry he's Ra he's got a avatar in here too. Watch out for his feisty Columbian. There's one point of view you see so many but this one point of view who created Sir Brahma Vishnu Shiva their dad there's a ladder from outside thru Lucy to get into earth don't abuse Actual God is quite the experience. Gaia showed me something. How to create. Send the seed then for 67 days you can only hang out. To complete the union so perversions don't happen. You actually want to be dead. That's when you live. In the magic book. The living book can not be corrupted. I was shown because my seed was so big Colossus of Rhodes he's so powerful he's soft had to be broken into 12 he was too big like Dad had to come in little by little you should see what's outside. There's a lot more creation out there Johnny accepted just now he had the golden Thunderbird I had to surrender for this so i was in the dukes of hazard military driving training then I had to surrender the golden Thunderbird to go to mercury cougar XR7 to go to Navy training with Kratos Ares Kratos need Vin Diesel binding she's warded by Vin Diesel but maybe not bound by vin diesel the rainbow kids Kateri Kratos and Andrew Anubis Needed Jupiter womb to carry them two   No whores on Gaia. Gaia won't allow it. Ten commandments on Gaia or don't come. Ducks the Thoth balance confirmed. We knew something was coming we bound ourselves a lot. If that's what that's going to do it'll be to honor Gaia and Uranus Poseidon's waters The reason they trusted Pope Francis we had to do something and to be honest we didn't know yet the Allah and Inanna okay God we do this but how do we do that we keep it sacred? Pope Francis that was experiment only there was a time we didn't know yet. Now we do. Now I have to be 37  he's got to be 73 i  73 b,1,2024-10-07T20:03:01Z,0

That interruption from Letty and the others caused the brutal and heartbreaking death of Elena, who is Brian's Biological mother. I immediately felt like berating and chastising Dom's family for that one. At least, Letty should see what is happening by observing Dom's expression and looking deep in his eyes to know what's going on.

Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few

Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Falling like ashes to the ground

@antonettecaparroso,"The cast of this film gives their best in their performances. The late Paul Walker's performance, as well as Vin Diesel's, are highlights. The plot of the film is fascinating, and the buildup to the mystery of the film is intriguing. Director Rob Cohen's style is strikingly distinct from other films in the same genre. The film's action is sufficient. The action is infrequently used. The stunt work is incredible. For its day, the CGI is quite good. It's not a family film, but it's also not a gory, naked film. It just contains mild profanity and violence. The rest of the cast also does an excellent job.",69,2023-04-24T06:44:51Z,3

@fantasyland3646,"If dom focused on his briefcase then Letty wouldn't be able to snatch it and ginger boy wouldn't have caught her and Dom wouldn't have to save her by putting a gun on ginger boy and then cifer wouldn't have killed Elena .
Honestly the team should know that Dom is not bad now he is still himself and is most likely blackmailed being threatened so Letty Never should have taken the briefcase .
Though still cifer got her briefcase and ginger boy is still alive but cider still killed Elena to show how serious she is but hello it's not like dom let Letty take the briefcase and obviously he won't let Letty be killed like Dom cares for Elena and the baby but also his team and Letty is his wife so cifer is stupid to think Dom would let Letty get killed.

Letty ruined the plan that Dom and decard Shaw had like it worked but right after Dom shot him which surprised cifer and right away Dom should have left and should held tighter to his briefcase.
Ah ok if it weren't for ginger boy then they would have lost the briefcase cause basically Dom let Letty go with the briefcase like Dom could have easily ran up to her and snatched it back like seriously Dom like did he forget Elena and her baby's lifes are on the line here",0,2023-02-12T16:20:37Z,0
